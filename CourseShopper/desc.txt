The first millennium BC saw a series of empires vying for control of the Near East: the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Persians, and the Greeks of Alexander the Great and his successors. The course will explore the political, social and cultural history of Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East under these empires, using evidence drawn from archaeology and ancient texts (in translation).# This seminar examines various examples of creative and poetic non-fiction, pertaining to race and the African American experience. While touching upon historic examples and precedent, emphasis will be on contemporary works, including the genres of poetry, drama, the narrative, the memoir, the travelogue and the personal essay. The course will explore what these works offer to the knowledge, popularization and perception of black history and to the shaping of cultural dialogue on blackness and race. Enrollment limited to 25.#Poetry in service to the community honors a connection between poetry and wisdom, assumes that poetry is a wisdom medium (vehicle, vessel, conveyance) toward more enlightened thinking and practice. In this way, it is also an ideal medium for extending our study and practice beyond Brown, conducting workshops in schools, community centers, youth detention facilities and elsewhere. The class emphasizes community building, in teaching pairs and classes and workshops throughout Providence, in Renga and workshop groups. Poetry is the connective tissue; building relationships is at the heart of the practice. Students will write and teach. Enrollment limited to 16.#Examines international development from an ethnographic perspective, looking critically at issues of poverty and progress from local points of view. Course is organized around the premise that culture is central to understanding processes of development. Broad development themes such as public health, agriculture, democracy, and the environment will be explored through readings representing a wide range of regions and cultures.#This is a topics course, covering a selection of modern applications of probability and statistics in the computational, cognitive, engineering, and neural sciences. The course will be rigorous, but the emphasis will be on application. Topics will likely include: Markov chains and their applications to MCMC computing and hidden Markov models; Dependency graphs and Bayesian networks; parameter estimation and the EM algorithm; Nonparametric statistics ("learning theory"), including consistency, bias/variance tradeoff, and regularization; Gibbs distributions, maximum entropy, and their connections to large deviations. Each topic will be introduced with several lectures on the mathematical underpinnings, and concluded with a computer project, carried out by each student individually, demonstrating the mathematics and the utility of the approach.#Offers comprehensive training in listening, speaking, reading, and writing with grammar review as needed. Broadens students' perspective of Arabic culture with selections from the classical and modern traditions of Arabic writing and various art forms. Five contact hours weekly. Prerequisite: ARAB 0500.#How did the Greeks and Romans perceive and discuss the beautiful and the ugly? The fragrant or malodorous? The ticklish and the tart? These may seem like difficult questions, even bizarre, and yet, in many ways, those past opinions inform our own experience of the world. This course is an exploration, through archaeological and literary primary sources, of the many ways in which ancient men and women interacted through their senses with the world around them and how they reflected upon that interaction.#Over five thousand years ago the first cities emerged in southern Iraq, and around that same time writing was invented, most likely to record the language we now call Sumerian. Even after it was no longer spoken, Sumerian became a powerful conduit for the region's cultural heritage, preserving its literature and religious traditions for millennia. In this course students will learn the fundamentals of Sumerian grammar, develop a basic working vocabulary, and explore the cuneiform script through weekly readings in original texts. Selections will come from royal inscriptions, court cases, myths, magical incantations, and even ancient schoolwork. No prerequisites. Enrollment limited to 20.#Continuation of Semester 1, BEO Capstone I: Organizational Studies Track (BEO 1930A). This course involves the completion of team projects begun in fall semester. WRIT#Lectures and recitation sections explore the mechanisms involved in the principles of macromolecular structure and function, the organization and regulation of pathways for intermediary metabolism, and the transfer of information from genes to proteins. It is expected that students have taken CHEM 0350 or are taking it concurrently.#This course continues to develop and strengthen students' proficiency in the Catalan language. The cultural component plays a central role in these classes, as a means to access diverse uses of the language within a cultural context. Varied cultural sources will be explored, such as Catalan cinema, music, artistic expressions, sociocultural elements and literature. These will play a role in enhancing the studentâ€™s confidence in their knowledge of the Catalan language and the context in which it is inserted. Students can expect to develop their language skills further, and to be active agents in their learning process. DVPS LILE#Sequel to CHEM 0330. Investigates the constitution and properties of the different classes of organic compounds, with considerable attention to reaction mechanisms. The laboratory work involves an introduction to microscale preparative and analytical techniques of organic chemistry and the preparation of representative organic compounds.

Exceptions to this policy must be approved by both the academic department and the Committee on Academic Standing.
#This course examines the way that death and dying were perceived and managed in ancient Roman culture. Primary source readings will include selections from philosophers, poets, inscriptions, and a variety of prose literature (consolations, epistolography, historiography, novels). Secondary literature will focus on demography and social relations, the anthropology of funerary ritual, and material culture, which will be integrated systematically throughout the course, and which will include consideration of artistic representations and iconography, as well the archaeology of Roman mortuary practices.#A survey covering the roles of inherited and environmental determinants of human behavior. Topics include sensation, perception, learning, memory, motivation, emotion, neural processes, language, social development, personality assessment, obedience, interpersonal attraction, and the diagnosis, origins, and treatment of mental illness.
